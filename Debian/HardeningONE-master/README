[+] Introduction
-------------------------------

  hardeningone is an auditing tool which tests and gathers (security) information from
  Unix based systems. The audience for this tool are security and system
  auditors, network specialists and system maintainers.
  
  Some of the (future) features and usage options:
  - System and security audit checks
  - File Integrity Assessment
  - System and file forensics
  - Usage of templates/baselines (reporting and monitoring)
  - Extended debugging features
    
  The name hardeningone is fictive and does not have a special meaning. Everyone is free
  to use hardeningone under the conditions of the GPL v3 license (see LICENSE file).

[+] Installation
-------------------------------

  hardeningone doesn't have to be installed, so it can be used directly from a
  (removable) disk. If you want the program to be installed, use one of the
  following methods:

  - Create a custom directory (ie. /usr/local/hardeningone) and unpack the tarball
    (tar xfvz hardeningone-version.tar.gz) into this directory.
  - Create a RPM package by using the hardeningone.spec file (see web site)
    run 'rpmbuild -ta hardeningone-version.tar.gz' (= build RPM package)
    run 'rpm -ivh <filename>' (= install RPM package)

  ========================
   Upgrade tip:
  ========================
  If you want to upgrade easily, make a shell script which removes an old
  installation, then unpacks and installs the new version. However, don't
  forget to migrate your dynamic files (like report / profile files).
  Or better: split these files up and make sure that you always use the right ones
  (especially with automated scanning).



[+] Supported systems
-------------------------------

  Since the complexity of auditing different systems and platforms, hardeningone is
  developed on BSD and Linux.
  
  This tool is tested or confirmed to work with:
  Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris



[+] Usage
-------------------------------

  See online documentation for more information about using hardeningone.
  


[+] Development
-------------------------------

  If you have input to improve hardeningone, let me know via the contact form. Although
  no additional developers are needed at this moment, you are free to send patches or
  input for consideration.



[+] Support
-------------------------------

  hardeningone is tested on the most common operating systems. The documentation (README,
  FAQ) and the debugging information in the log file should cover most questions and
  problems. Bugs can be reported by filling in the contact form at the web site.
  
  NOTE: User related questions should not be asked via the contact form. Read the
  documentation, the website resources and the log file for answers to common problems.

  Commercial support is available under strict conditions and depends on the request.
  For more information fill in the contact form and describe what kind of service is
  requested.



[+] Project donations
-------------------------------

  Individuals and companies which use this software for more than 10 systems, should
  consider the value of this tool. To improve my tools, I rely on internet sources,
  lots of books and a huge amount of time (spare time) investment. Book donations 
  are highly appreciated and stimulate development.
  


[+] Thanks
-------------------------------

  Thanks to the community for using and supporting open source software and my tools
  in particular. Many comments, bugs/patches and questions are the key to success
  and motivation in developing tools like this.
  
  A special thanks to anyone who donated a book or input in the past!
