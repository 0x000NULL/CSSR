# Cyber Security Scripts
A collection of scripts and programs that help to secure Windows, Ubuntu, and Debian machines.
<br><br><br>
## Windows Security
### WindowsStigs.bat
This script runs through the STIGS that are available for Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2008, Server 2008 R2, Server 2012, and Server 2012 R2. <br>This script was made for a cyber defense competition, therefore some of the script may not be applicable to some scenarios, however the script should still work. <br> It also secures a few other settings that I felt would be helpful. <br> The comments give a general idea of what sections are doing.
<br>
### Windowshf.py
This program is written for Python 3. <br> This program checks all the files it can access on the system against a list of md5 hashes. <br> It is essentially acting as a rudimentary anti-virus. <br> The program will print the location of a found vulnerability and also print it to an output file.

### WindowsSecurity.ps1
This script runs through some STIGS (and some other options) that are available for Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2008, Server 2008 R2, Server 2012, and Server 2012 R2. <br>This script was made for the a cyber defense competition, therefore some of the script may not be applicable to some scenarios, however the script should still work.

## Linux Security
### Ubuntuhf.py
This program is written for Python 3 and for Ubuntu 14.04.5(x32) as the hashes differ in different versions. <br> This program checks all the files it can access on the system against a list of md5 hashes. <br> It is essentially acting as a rudimentary anti-virus. <br> The program will print the location of a found vulnerability and also print it to an output file.
<br>
### Debianhf.py
This program is written for Python 3 and for Debian 7.6(x32) as the hashes differ in different versions. <br> This program checks all the files it can access on the system against a list of md5 hashes. <br> It is essentially acting as a rudimentary anti-virus. <br> The program will print the location of a found vulnerability and also print it to an output file.
