# CyberPatriot
Different cyberpatriot checklists and scripts I wrote
## Checklists
1.Linux Checklist
- Basic checklist to harden a linux server.

2.Windows Checklist
- Basic checklist to harden a windows operating system.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Scripts
1.Linux_Ubuntu.sh
- Script that is written to do everything in the checklist plus more.
- Script not perfected, still requires a lot of work.

2.Windows.bat
- Script that does basic securing, checklist is still needed to fully harden the system.

## Random
1.CPScrapper.py
- This is just a simple web scraper that I made with python3 that will scrape all the scores from the cyberpatriot scoreboard and put them in an excel spreadsheet for future use.
