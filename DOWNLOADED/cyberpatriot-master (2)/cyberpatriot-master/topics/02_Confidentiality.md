# Confidentiality (blog)

As mentioned in the introductory message, the primary principles of cybersecurity are Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

Confidentiality is the principle that most people will associate with cybersecurity.  It is the principle of how to keep my information or objects from being seen or accessed by unwanted or unauthorized people, or disclosing it.  Stuff that is commonly protected include bank accounts.

The primary methods to protect the information include controlling access to the information and encoding the information in only a way that you can decode it with cryptography.

If I did not want you to read a document, I could put the document on a flash drive, drop the drive into a safe, fill the safe with cement, lock it, and drop it in a undisclosed location in the ocean.  If that was done, you most likely would not be able to read the document.  Even if you found the safe, the flash drive would most likely be destroyed.  This is an extreme method of controlling access to the document.

Encoding a document is like the replacement codes where you replace one letter with another letter, and only the authorized people know which letters to replace with.  This can be as simple as each letter is replaced with a letter that is rotated 13 characters away (rot13), or even more complex than running several mathematical equations on a block of characters.  An example, the answer the the best way to fix computers is below:

What are some items that you, or someone else, use every day that will keep stuff confidential?
