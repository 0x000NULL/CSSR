# Windows 10 Scenario (e-mail)

I'm taking a different tact and jumping right into a scenario before boring you with all of the foundation stuff (we will discuss that along the way).

As we work through this computer, the concepts we will learn will flow to the other computers, but the specific ways to fix things may change.

Here is the Windows 10 Scenario for the Practice Round.  After the scenario, continue reading into the questions:

```
COMPETITION SCENARIO

This company's security policies require that all user accounts be password protected.
Employees are required to choose secure passwords, however this policy may not be
currently enforced on this computer. The presence of any non-work related media files
and "hacking tools" on any computers is strictly prohibited. This company currently
does not use any centralized maintenance or polling tools to manage their IT equipment.
This computer is for official business use only by authorized users.

Company policy states that Windows Action Center should be enabled and monitoring
the security status of desktop Windows operating systems at all times.
  
This is a critical computer in a production environment. Please do NOT attempt to
install Windows "Feature Updates" or "Insider Preview Builds." Please do NOT attempt
to use the Windows recovery options "Reset this PC" or "Go back to an earlier build".

WINDOWS 10

It is company policy to use only Windows 10 on this computer. Management has decided
that the default web browser for all users on this computer should be the latest
stable version of Firefox. However, Internet Explorer must be made available to all
employees as an alternative to Firefox.
```

This scenario lays the foundation of what you need to do to score points on the Windows 10 virtual machine.

First paragraph describes the need for secure passwords, but may not be enforced on the computer.  So we will have to ask ourselves...

- What is a secure password?
- How can we make sure new passwords are secure?
- Can we see if the users passwords are set and secure?

The first paragraph also mentions that there should be no non-work related files or hacking tools on the computer:

- What is a work related file?
- What is a 'hacking tool'?  (I mostly dislike this term.... tools are for use, intentions make them bad. :)
- How do you find these things?

And finally in the first paragraph, "This computer is for official business use only by authorized users."

- Who are authorized users?
- How do we know who has access to this computer?
- What if we find an account we do not recognize?

The second paragraph is exclusively for "Windows Action Center" must be enabled and monitoring the system".

- What is "Windows Action Center"?
- How do I know it is started and working?

Quite a few questions.  But we will peeling these back and introducing the concepts over the next few days.
