# Password and Password Managers (blog)

Passwords may not be the best form of security, but due to the ease of use, they tend to be the most widely used.  Creating good passwords can be a skill.

The rules of a good password use include:
* Always contain at least 3 of the following:
  * Uppercase letters
  * Lowercase letters
  * Numbers
  * Symbols (!@#$%^...)
* Always use at least 8 characters (key presses)
* Never share a password.
* Do not use dictionary words.
* Do not use personal or public information, such as names.
* Do not  use the same password for different systems.
* Change passwords periodically.

A good method for creating passwords is to find 2 words, combine with a symbol, and replace some of the characters with numbers and symbols.  For example:

**F1uffy#3leph@nt**

The rule of 'Do not use the same password for different systems' can make remembering all your passwords hard.  In this case many people use what is called a password manager.  Password managers is a vault that you can store your passwords in, and use a single master password to access.  This can increase your security by allowing you to create different passwords on each system with out having to write them down or memorize each one.  But it can also make it less secure because that one master password must be secure and confidential.
