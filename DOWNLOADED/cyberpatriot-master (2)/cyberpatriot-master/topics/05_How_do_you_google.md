The meme is a good one that doesn't hit too far from the truth.  When people come to me with issues on computers, there are times I may know the answers, but many times I do not.  Knowing how to find an answer when you do not know the answer is an important skill.

Some good tips for searching the internet can be found in this article: [10 tips for smarter, more efficient Internet searching](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-tips-for-smarter-more-efficient-internet-searching/)

* Use unique, specific terms
* Use the minus operator (-) to narrow the search
* Use quotation marks for exact phrases
* Don't use common words and punctuation
* Capitalization
* Drop the suffixes
* Maximize AutoComplete
* Customize your searches
* Use browser history
* Set a time limit â€” then change tactics

I'm not trying to say that internet searching will make you a computer guru.  With the knowledge you have, and the knowledge you gain through programs like CyberPatriot, you will be able to improve your search ability, and help people with finding answers to their computer issues.  While searching for answers, you may also learn something.
