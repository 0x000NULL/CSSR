# Windows 10 and Passwords (e-mail)

Everybody loves passwords. Passwords are the life blood of our lives.  And, I have a bridge to sell you if you are interested.

Passwords are method of authentication, a method to confirm who you are.  They are the primary way that we use to secure systems.  This is not because passwords are good at their job.  It is more because the are easy to use.  Passwords tend to be (relatively) easy to guess, and if not guessed, social engineered, and easy to change when they are compromised.  To make passwords more useful, we need to put rules around password usage.  Rules like...

 - longer length
 - use of special characters
 - do not use dictionary words
 - expiration of the passwords
 - do not allow reuse of frequent passwords

These rules are enforced by the operating system, and you will learn how to set some these values.

Tasks that we will do on the Windows image during the next training will be...

- Assigning a password to each user on the computer.
- Setting a minimum password length.
- Enforce a password history.
- Set a password age.

We will share methods of doing each of these, but I encourage you to search the InterWeb to see if you can find your own ways of doing these.

Can you think of better ways to prove your authenticity, or authenticate who you are?  There are different categories that you can look at:

- What you know.  This would be passwords, PINs, security questions.
- What you have. This tends to be a key FOB, or an application on smart phone.
- What you are. This is biometrics, such as finger prints and retina scans.
- Where you are. You location can be a factor of authenticity.
- Why not all. Multi-factor, or combining 2 or more categories raises the bar for security.
