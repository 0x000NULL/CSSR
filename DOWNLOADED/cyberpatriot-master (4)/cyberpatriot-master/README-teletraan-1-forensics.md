    You are accessing an Autobot Information System (IS) that is provided
    for Autobot-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes any
    device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:
    * The Autobots routinely intercept and monitor communications on this IS
    for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, space
    bridge security, network operations and defense, and counterintelligence
    (CI) investigations.
    * At any time, the Autobots may inspect and seize data stored on this
    IS.
    * Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are
    subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be
    disclosed or used for any USG authorized purpose.
    * The IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access
    controls) to protect Autobot interests - not for your personal benefit
    or privacy.
