<h1>Technical Notes</h1>

<h3>Computer System Changes</h3>
<p>In some instances, if changes to the computer system are made while the Coach Configuration Tool is running, for example, adding a new user or adding a share, or other modifications not already configured to be monitored, the Coach Configuration Tool must be restarted for it to see the new changes made. </p>

<h3>Update VMWare Tools</h3>
<p>When running the Coach Configuration Tool in Microsoft Windows 10 as a VMWare guest, users may experience poor performance when moving the window around the screen.  For best performance install the latest version of VMWare Tools on the guest virtual machine.
