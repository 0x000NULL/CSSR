<h1>Features Tab</h1>

<p>The Features tab contains a list of detected Windows features such as Games, Media Features, .NET Framework, etc.</p>
<p>Each item can be set to Enabled or Disabled.</p>
<p>Select the desired value for each item and select the Scoring checkbox to score on that item.</p>
<p>Scoring will be performed when the user configures the features to match the specified values in the list.</p>
<p>Note that the Scoring Engine takes about five seconds to check each item that has been set to scoring, therefore selecting multiple features will require longer update time.</p>
