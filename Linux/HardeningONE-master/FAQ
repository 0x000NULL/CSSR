================================================================================

[+] General
-------------------------------

  Q: I don't understand the program (output), what to do?
  A: Keep reading this FAQ, then continue with reading the README file, followed
     by the log file (default: /var/log/hardeningone.log). After those sources, there
     is still the internet left.

  Q: I can't find any configuration file for hardeningone, where is it?
  A: There isn't one (currently), since all options are available as command
     parameters. Specific options to control the audit/security scan can be set
     or adjusted by changing the 'profile' file you are using (don't use
     default.prf for your own custom options, but make a copy of it).
  
  Q: Why is there no port/package for my operating system?
  A: Because there is no maintainer for it yet. If you have the time to keep
     the port/package current for your preferred operating system, fill in the
     contact form to notify me and confirm no one else is working on it.

  Q: What to do with the report files?
  A: Currently the files don't contain much information yet. The output won't
     change much, so you could use them for monitoring, for example. 
     

  
[+] Usage problems
-------------------------------
  Q: hardeningone hangs while testing the group files (grpck)
  A: Run the grpck command manually. It will most likely need user input, to
     repair incorrect groups.
     
  Q: hardeningone doesn't display all messages on a white background
  A: White text is used for general (and important) messages. Most terminals
     have a dark background, so it gives extra attention to the message. However
     if you have a white background (for example Mac OS X), you can run hardeningone
     with --no-colors to strip colors or --reverse-colors to reverse the color
     scheme. Another option is to change your terminal colors within Mac OS. 
  
  Q: Some tests take very long to finish, what to do?
  A: Use a second console (or connection) and check the output of ps/lsof etc,
     to see the status of the active subroutine. If a specific test hangs for a
     very long time, try to kill that specific process (ie grpck) and see if
     hardeningone continues. Afterwards, run the command manually to see the cause.
     Check the log file for additional information, when possible.

  Q: When running hardeningone, it shows me the usage help even while using correct
     parameters, why?
  A: This can happen with alternative shells. Try using a different shell to
     invoke hardeningone (example: bash hardeningone -c)     

  Q: One or more tests are giving incorrect output. How to solve that?
  A: Check the log file. If that also has incorrect data, fill in the contact
     form and describe the issue.
     
  Q: The program takes long to complete and also uses too much resources. Can it
     be tuned?
  A: The time it takes to complete is depends on the amount of tests to run.
     However the resources it take can be slighty lowered by increasing the
     pause_between_tests profile option. Keep in mind this increased the length
     of the run to complete.



[+] Network related issues
-------------------------------

  Q: hardeningone reports promiscuous interfaces, but they are needed for normal operation,
     how can I hide this warning?
  A: Whitelist the interface in the profile file (if_promisc).
