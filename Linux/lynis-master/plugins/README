  General notes
  ---------------

  Custom plugins should be added to this directory, so they are included
  in an audit.

  Notes:

    - File permissions of a plugin should be 600, 640 or the least
      restrictive 400.
    - Each plugin should be enabled in the profile, before it will be
      activated.
    - Custom plugins should use a test ID's with a "CUS-" prefix.

    A generic example can be found in the custom_plugin.template file,
    which includes several code snippets to assist in creating customer
    plugins.

    Community plugins are available under a restricted license.
