# How to use this tool
Here is a quick guide for using this script

1. You must have all the files in one folder
2. You must make the main.sh file executable `$ sudo chmod +x main.sh`
3. You run the main.sh file like so... `$ sudo ./main.sh`
4. Follow the pompts along the way, it may take some time.

And that's all there is to it!
