# Easy Image

This is the collection of information/items for the Easy (or "Easy" as difficulty is relative) practice that I created for the CyberPatriot competition. This includes basic security basics like removing bad users and correcting user permissions, removing potentially dangerous packages/files and fixing some basic configuration settings.
