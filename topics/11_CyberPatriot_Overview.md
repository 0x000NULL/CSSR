# CyberPatriot Overview (e-mail)

The CyberPatriot competition has a number of challenges that each one of you can assist or focus in.  This is an overview of what a competition will be like.

The competition will have  2-4 virtual computers that you will be able to work on.  The images may be:

 - Windows 10 - a desktop Windows system
 - Windows 2016 - a server Windows system
 - Ubuntu 16 - a desktop Linux system
 - Debian 8 - a server Linux system

The difference between the desktop and server systems is that a desktop is more for you average use for browsing web sites and running programs and a server is used for serving up the web sites or enterprise programs.

Each of the virtual computers will have a scenario attached with it.  The scenario will describe what is allowable on the computer as a part of the pretend company it is used in.  It will give hints on what to look for and what you can do to get points.

Points are scored for:

- Answering Forensics about the scenario.
- Fixing issues with the computer based on the scenario.
- Securing the computer to prevent future issues.

Points will be removed for:

- Removing required services,
- Removing valid users and directories.
- Not securing the computer enough.

If these sound intimidating, do not be put off.  I hope to introduce a lot of the topics, along with you having the power of Google (or Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo).

Next few e-mails will start going over the computer that you are most likely the most familiar with, Windows 10.
