# DISA Stigs (e-mail)

On Sunday, I shared a document called a DISA STIG.  These documents are what the Department of Defense (technically Defense Information Security Agency) published as minimum standards to secure the systems.  The documents may be dry, but they can provide a benefit for the CyberPatriot.

The documents are a list of items to be done to secure systems.  The documents cover many computers and systems, including the systems that are in CyberPatriot.  Each item in the list contains 2 pieces of information that will really help you out:

1. Check Text - a procedure that will tell you how to check if something is configured properly.
2. Fix Text - a procedure on how to configure the item.

When we were going through the practice images, there were password policies that we had set to secure a password.  With the STIGs, you could do this...

1. Go to STIGViewer at https://www.stigviewer.com/stigs
2. Find the system you are looking for (Windows 10) and open that page.
3. Search for all items for 'password'.  You will find items like...
    - The password history must be configured to 24 passwords remembered.
    - The maximum password age must be configured to 60 days or less.	
4. Open the item, and look at the Fix Text in the Details.

If you follow these in the competition (or practice, or at home,..), the settings that they provide should go above and beyond what the requirements of the competition is.

The take away, remember to check https://www.stigviewer.com/stigs if you run out of ideas to search for.
