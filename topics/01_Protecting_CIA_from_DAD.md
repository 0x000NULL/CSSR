# Protecting CIA from DAD (blog)

What is CyberPatriot?  For the official statement of what the CyberPatriot is, the website at http://uscyberpatriot.org/ states:

    WHAT IS CYBERPATRIOT?  CyberPatriot is the National Youth Cyber Education Program.  CyberPatriot was conceived by the Air Force Association (AFA) to inspire high school students toward careers in cybersecurity or other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines critical to our nation's future.

In CyberPatriot, the cadets learn topics that include general security, virtualization, patching, anti-virus, services, firewalls, malware, and networking.  As time permits, we will dig into vulnerability scanning, information gathering, and scripting.  Training is available for everyone, and the competition team will be Cadets in high school.

What is with some central intelligence and a father figure in the title?  Nothing.  CIA is a core concept of cybersecurity; Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.  Cybersecurity is always working to find a balance of those three concepts.  And for the father figure... it is the opposite of CIA.  It is Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction.
