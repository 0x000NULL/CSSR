# Availability (blog)

And for the principle of cybersecurity that most people may not think about when talking about security... availability.  With out availability to data and information, there is no purpose for the data.  If the data gets destroyed, money and knowledge is lost.  Availability makes sure we can get access to the data, whether there are power failures or flooded networks.

From the discussion on confidentiality, locking a flash drive in a safe with cement will destroy the availability to the data.  Access control is still a key method to protect availability, but will make sure the good subjects can get access to the data while keeping out the bad.  A popular attack on availability are denial of services (DoS) attacks that will overwhelm websites to the point of shutting them down, or not allowing anyone else to get to them.

As with integrity, backups and restores also serve as a strong method to protect availability.  If data gets destroyed, it can be restored to a prior point in time.  Redundancy, or having multiple parts servicing a single purpose, is another main method to maintain availability.  Many business systems have multiple hard drives in servers, so that if a single hard drive fails, the server continues to operate.

Examples of attacks on availability include:

- Denial of service attacks on websites to shut them down.
- Crypto locker malware that will lock people out of their computers, encrypt files, and extort money from them to restore the files.

Can you think of other incidents that can happen to affect availability to information?
