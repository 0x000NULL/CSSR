# Integrity (blog)

The second principle of cybersecurity is integrity.  This is the preservation of the data and guarantee that data that goes into the system comes out intact, and stays true, without alteration.

Access control remains as a core method to maintain integrity.

Encryption is also use, but in a method to create a unique value based on the contents of the data, that can be compared as you move the data around.  This is a concept we will use directly when downloading file for CyberPatriot.

One of the main methods of integrity is backup and recovery.  By maintaining periodic backups, you are able to recover the information.  Many people keep their important information on a flash drive, with out making copies of the flash drive.  One day they pull the flash drive out of the USB port a bit too quick, and off comes the duck bill, and no long have access to the important information.

So how is integrity attacked?  There are two examples I can think of off the top of my head:

* Website defacement is on the top of the list.  People with malicious that want to be known or make a political statement, will attack popular websites and change the content of the front page.  Two popular groups that known for defacing websites are Anonymous and the Syrian Electronic Army.
* Straight from Hollywood, changing grades at school to get a better grade.  Even way back in 1983... [War Games 1983 School Hack.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/O77v7lVKgNU)

Can you think of any other examples of data alteration that must be protected against?
